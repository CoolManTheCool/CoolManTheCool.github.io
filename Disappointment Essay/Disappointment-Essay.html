      <h2>Server Enhancement Suggestions</h2>
      <p>&emsp;Hey, I've noticed some aspects of this server could use heavy improvement. To start, switch to Paper (or even better, Purpur) as it adds access to plugins such as Via Version. There is an issue with permissions, with some admins forcing themselves (and likely others) into a voice-channel that is inaccessible to other members. Paper comes with a built-in anti-xray feature. Adding Gram-AC will remove cheaters, almost removing the need for moderators. Addressing these issues will significantly enhance the server experience for everyone. I'm willing to work together to find solutions and improve your server.</p>

      <h2>Concerns about Rules and Moderation</h2>
      <p>&emsp;Your server also has an issue with rules and moderation, @noobzeld's Offensive Material Limit is stupid, Members are regularly using racial slurs and other offensive material. Your #rules channel is poorly made and isn't kept up-to-date. Your moderation team and some of your members have me blocked, so I cannot get support from them.</p>

      <h2>Account Departures and Concerns</h2>
      <p>&emsp;Me and @harry.9637's accounts: HarryBoi33 and PeanutButter33, have quit. You should have noticed the signs, having previously problematic members playing on your server while obviously cheating and using alt accounts, when multiple members are cheating together, they are probably doing it for a common goal, in my case our goal was to get you to add plugins such as: Via Version, Grim AC, Via Backwards and to properly setup your servers.</p>

      <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
      <p>&emsp;You are clearly blinded with ignorance, by not understanding or fulfilling your community's requirements. This is truly disappointing, as we have been trying to get you to follow our demands. Our goal is just to improve you, not stop you. We believe you and your community have potential, but you, and mostly the other owners are lacking the ability to follow through with requests. Too many times have you said something and it not have been true, as well as saying you'll do something and not following through.</p>
      <br><p>&emsp;When the server was initially a good idea, a vanilla SMP with stat-boosting artifacts, providing players who grinded a reward. Your implementation of this idea was poor, you limited crafting the artifacts to when the moderators were online, anyone who isn’t in the same timezone has an automatic disadvantage. The majority of the members are friends with the moderators, which isn’t necessarily bad, but in this case those members are getting special treatment, like direct access to the moderators and support teams.</p>
      <br><p>&emsp;The head moderator, Noobzeld, repeatedly accepts a request to do something and either finds an excuse or avoids doing it entirely, he also tells members there is a world-border, this is simply not true as I have flown very very far away from where the border should be. We are willing to play your server, as well as sending our members your way, improving your play count. This will not happen without every one of these demands being fulfilled or at least considered.</p>
